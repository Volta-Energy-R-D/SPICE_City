# Test 1 Instructions

In this test, you will complete an application that processes student data.

- Please view the sample file, data.txt, that you will use.
- Once you build your application, you will use it as follows (note that file locations may vary):
- At the Linux prompt ($):
- $ cat data.txt | ./ese2025_test1 <argv[1]> <argv[2]>

Note that argv[1] is a string literal representing a command, and argv[2] is a string literal representing the command argument. There are two commands, namely, "find" and "sort". The find command is followed by a family name by which to sort. The sort command is followed by keywords "family", "given" or "grades" and produces a sorted version of the entire database, sorted by family name, given name, or grades, respectively.

Please look through the code and identify the FIVE coding problems that you must solve. Make regular and meaningful commits as you develop your code.

You have until 12AM, April 21st, 2020, to complete the test.
