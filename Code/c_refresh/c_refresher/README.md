# C-Language Refresher and Some Unix Refreshers as well

There is the classic BASH tutorial guide... check out Chapter 2 for the illuminating progression from beginner to advanced BASH.

Also the notes I wrote for a C-programming class once upon a time.

There is also a nice tutorial on make with makefiles progressing from "beginner" to "advanced" as well.

Enjoy!
